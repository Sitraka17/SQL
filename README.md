SQL is the core base of Data. Let's go into a structured adventure!

SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

SQL terminology In SQL, which stands for **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage , data is arranged in tables where each row is a record and each column is a field. SQL is used to query relational databases that contain a collection of tables. It is not used to visualize data. A query is a request for data from a database table, or combination of tables. A query uses keywords , such as SELECT and FROM. Since SQL is not case sensitive, it does not differentiate between SELECT and select . 
However, it is good practice to make SQL keywords uppercase to distinguish them from other parts of your query, like column and table names. Every SQL query should end with a semi-colon *;* , which tells SQL to terminate the query.

The **GROUP BY** keyword allows you to group a result by one or more columns.

The **ORDER BY** keyword sorts results according to the specified column or columns. **NULL** values will appear first in the result.



""SQL is everywhere."" 
SQL is life ❤️ 

Here are some quick tips from beginner to advanced you should know and be able to talk about in a SQL interview.

Beginner 
- Be able to explain the different types of joins. The famous 2 then 3 circle grqph cqn help you
- Know when HAVING is run in SQL's order of operations vs WHERE
- Know the difference between UNION and **UNION ALL** (link)[httpsjsp]

Mid
- Understand how to use a **CASE** statement inside of a SUM or COUNT function;
- Know at least 1-2 ways you could optimize a query and if you decide one of those answers will be put an index on the table..you should also know what the pros and cons of an index are
- Be able to implement both a subquery and CTE, but use a CTE if you want to prove that you have good SQL habits.
    also yeah you need to know that a CTE is a common table expression; 

Advanced
- Know how to answer a problem with and without a window function. Usually you will need to implement a *self join* in order to imitate some window functions such as LAG and LEAD.
- Understand and be able to explain what a **correlated subquery** is
- Just reference that you would look at the *query execution plan*. They will be shocked you even know what that is. (A query execution plan is the definition of: The sequence in which the source tables are accessed. The methods used to extract data from each table. Generally, there are different methods for accessing the data in each table.)
