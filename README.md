SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

SQL terminology In SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language , data is arranged in tables where each row is a record and each column is a field. SQL is used to query relational databases that contain a collection of tables. It is not used to visualize data. A query is a request for data from a database table, or combination of tables. A query uses keywords , such as SELECT and FROM . Since SQL is not case sensitive, it does not differentiate between SELECT and select . However, it is good practice to make SQL keywords uppercase to distinguish them from other parts of your query, like column and table names. Every SQL query should end with a semi-colon ; , which tells SQL to terminate the query.
